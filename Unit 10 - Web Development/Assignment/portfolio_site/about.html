        I’ve been teaching ICT at the G.C.E. A/L level in Sri Lanka for several years, blending technical expertise with creative teaching strategies. My goal is to make complex concepts accessible, especially for students with diverse learning needs and minimal prior exposure to technology.

        Beyond the classroom, I’m deeply curious about emerging technologies like agentic AI and enjoy participating in hackathons to stay sharp and inspired. I believe that education should be both rigorous and empathetic—rooted in real-world relevance and personal growth.
